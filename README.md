# Trustee-pay

It's a special environment for apps and devices to confirm payment by the trustee.

We're going to create a special system, that aims on giving the trustee full control on the payment confirmation.

Here is the future feature list:
1. Ð¡ontactless payment with confirmation

2. Ban on certain categories

3. Automatic confirmation for the necessary categories (public transport, school meals, etc.)

4. Control or prohibition of transfers to other accounts

5. Restriction of information about the used credit card (display of hidden information with confirmation)
6. Detailing by category (to assist in decision making)

7. Restriction of spending in certain categories in a certain period of time (in n days / n months / n years)

You can find first mockups [here](https://www.figma.com/file/IFO6WMypr3dSOrF1EAgXIg/Concordia?node-id=18%3A12).

Will be glad any help :)
